✅ Day 2: Data Lifecycle
=========================
🔍 Summary:
The Data Lifecycle refers to the stages through which data passes:
1. Data Collection – Gathering raw data (e.g., surveys, sensors)
2. Data Storage – Saving in DBs, data lakes, or cloud
3. Data Cleaning – Removing duplicates, handling nulls
4. Data Analysis – Using tools to extract insights
5. Data Visualization – Charts/dashboards for stakeholders
6. Data Archival/Deletion – Store or discard old data securely


--> Collect - Analyse - Insights 


🧠 Example:
In Flipkart, product order data is collected → stored in MySQL → cleaned → analyzed for demand → visualized in dashboards for managers.


Data Analytics Workflow
=======================
🔍 Summary:
This is the step-by-step process analysts follow:

Define the Problem

Collect Relevant Data

Clean & Prepare Data

Analyze the Data

Interpret Results

Communicate Findings (via reports or dashboards)

🧠 Example:
An analyst at Zomato wants to reduce cart abandonment.

Collects user session data

Cleans missing clicks

Analyzes time-on-page

Presents drop-off rates to product team



Structured vs Unstructured Data (Deep Dive)
===========================================
🔍 Summary:
Structured: Stored in tables (SQL), easy to query

Unstructured: Free-form (text, images, audio), hard to process without AI/ML

🧠 Example:
Structured: Sales report in Excel

Unstructured: A customer complaint in an email


Key Tools Used in Data Analytics
================================
🔍 Summary:
Excel – Fast calculations, visual charts

SQL – Querying databases

Python – Advanced data handling

Power BI / Tableau – Dashboard creation

Jupyter Notebooks – Documentation + code in one

🧠 Example:
A startup analyst might use:

SQL to extract sales data

Python to clean & model it

Power BI to visualize trends

google b query - GitHub - DBT - Data Build Tool - FiveTran - Salesforce - Tableau



What is Business Intelligence (BI)?
===================================
🔍 Summary:
BI involves using tools and practices to turn raw data into meaningful business insights. BI often uses dashboards, charts, and visualizations.

🧠 Example:
A telecom company uses BI dashboards to monitor dropped calls, data usage, and customer churn rate.
